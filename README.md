Pre-Soak part II (because part 1 is already created last lesson)
Doing lessons will the doing laundry. Such great way to start the day!
Pre-soak makes me think of premeds for antibody infusions, certain
chemo infusions. The premeds will help prevent anaphylactic shock
or code blue.

#remote edit:
So when there is code blue, as the responding pharmacist (or as my retail patients calls me "pharmist")
must carry this code bag that's got lots of life saving drugs in them and run as fast as I can.
The Code Bag is approx. 8 lbs and running with an 8 lb bag on your back is a challenge... and you have to run
thru the hospital, get to the elevator, if the elevator is broke, hello stairs! It is NOT for out of shape
people like me. But I get there, get the drugs, listen to the doctor running the code and respond to what he needs
and always hope the patient survives... because they don't always survive... :(
